            <p>The best part about French cuisine is definitely the baked goods – beautiful baguettes, marvelous
                macarons, and of
                course, the quintessential <b>chocolate croissant!</b> This recipe even takes it a step further and puts
                a
                double chocolate twist on the classic croissant's buttery, flakey
                deliciousness.

                <h3><b>Directions:</b></h3>
                <p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
                <p>For the chocolate dough, first add the water, sugar, butter, and yeast mixture to a large bowl.
                    Combine the lukewarm
                    milk and dry yeast and add it to the large bowl. In a separate bowl, mix 3–4 tablespoons of water
                    with the cocoa powder
                    until a thick paste forms. Add the cocoa paste to the large bowl and knead the ingredients using an
                    hand mixer with a
                    dough hook. Once a smooth dough has formed, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2
                    hours.</p>

                <p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 350°F and dust your work surface with flour. Remove the chocolate dough from the
                    fridge and roll it
                    out into a 20 x 14-inch rectangle. Place the puff pastry sheet on top of the chocolate dough and
                    roll the rolling pin
                    over both simultaneously, merging them together.
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 3:</b></p>
                <p>Use a pizza cutter to trim off any excess dough. You should be left with an even, rectangular piece
                    of dough with
                    straight edges.
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 4:</b></p>
                <p>Make marks at 4-inch intervals at both the top and bottom of the dough rectangle. Using a pizza
                    cutter, cut straight
                    lines in the dough, connecting the marks you made. Cut each rectangle diagonally to form even
                    triangles.
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 5:</b></p>
                <p>Make a small incision on the wide side of the dough triangle and place a rectangular bar of chocolate
                    on the dough near
                    the incision.
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 6:</b></p>
                <p>Roll up the dough, starting at the wider end, to form a croissant shape. Repeat this technique with
                    the remainder of the
                    ingredients and place the double chocolate croissants on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
                    Transfer the baking
                    tray to the oven and bake at 350°F for 20 minutes.
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 7:</b></p>
                <p>Remove the croissants from the oven and let them cool. Mix the apricot jam with some water to thin it
                    slightly, then
                    heat the mixture on low heat until warm. Brush the apricot glaze over the cooled croissants.
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 8:</b></p>
                <p>Now your double chocolate croissants are ready to be served!
                </p>
