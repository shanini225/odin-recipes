                <h3><b>Directions:</b></h3>
                <p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
                <p>For the pastry, put the plain flour, butter, icing sugar, egg yolk (save the white for the meringue)
                    and 1 tbsp cold water into afood processor. Pulse until the mix starts to bind, make sure the mix is
                    not overworked.</p>

                <p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
                <p>Tip the pastry onto a lightly floured surface, gather together until smooth, then roll out and line a
                    23 x 2.5cm loose-bottom fluted flan tin. Trim and neaten the edges. Press pastry into the flutes.
                    The pastry is quite rich, so don’t worry if it cracks, just press it back together. Prick the base
                    with a fork, line with foil, shiny side down, and chill for 30 mins-1 hr (or overnight).
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 3:</b></p>
                <p>Put a baking sheet in the oven and heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bake the pastry case ‘blind’
                    (filled with drybeans) for 15 mins, then remove the foil and bake a further 5-8 mins until the
                    pastry is pale golden and cooked. Set aside. Can be done a day ahead. Lower the oven to 180C/160C
                    fan/gas 4.
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 4:</b></p>
                <p>While the pastry bakes, prepare the filling. Mix the cornflour, golden caster sugar and lemon zest in
                    a medium saucepan. Strain and stir in the lemon juice gradually. Make the orange juice up to 200ml
                    with water and strain into the pan. Cook over a medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened
                    and smooth.
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 5:</b></p>
                <p>Once the mixture bubbles, remove from the heat and beat in the butter until melted. Beat the egg
                    yolks (save white for meringue) and the whole egg together, stir into the pan and return to a medium
                    heat. Keep stirring vigorously for a few minutes, until the mixture thickens and plops from the
                    spoon. (It will bubble, but doesn’t curdle.) Take off the heat and set aside while you make the
                    meringue.
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 6:</b></p>
                <p>Put the egg whites in a large bowl. Whisk to soft peaks, then add 100g of the golden caster sugar a
                    spoonful at a time, whisking between each addition without overbeating. Whisk in the cornflour, then
                    add the remaining 100g of sugar as before until smooth and thick.
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 7:</b></p>
                <p>Quickly reheat the filling and pour it into the pastry case. Immediately put spoonfuls of meringue
                    around the edge of the filling (if you start in the middle, the meringue may sink), then spread so
                    it just touches the pastry (this will anchor it and help stop it sliding). Pile the rest into the
                    centre, spreading so it touches the surface of the hot filling (and starts to cook), then give it
                    all a swirl.
                </p>

                <p><b>Step 8:</b></p>
                <p>Return to the oven for 18-20 mins until the meringue is crisp and slightly coloured. Let the pie sit
                    in the tin for 30
                    mins, then remove and leave for at least another 30 mins-1 hr before slicing. Eat the same day.
